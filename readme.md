# Satan Lang

I would like to have my own programming language, ya know it feels cool, kinda edgy to write backend in your own language.

I really love TypeScript and some concept from C#. Using NestJS I found a lot of tricks, ya know decorators and stuff to make things nice and I thought: Hey! What if I could make language without having to use those tricks, designed only for writing web APIs. Also I could take my favourite things from others languages, yay!

# Specs
- Compiled to native code or javascript ^_^
- Code splitting like in C# - using namespaces, coz I love this concept
- Strongy and statically typed with type before variable name, coz I love this in that way.
- Type names like Rust - i32, u32, etc.
- OOP like in C#
- New keywords - controller, model, dto and much more I can come up with

Check out examples folder for some insight.

# Concept
It's a concept for now, I don't know if I ever be able to do that, it can be too ambitious to actually make it.

> If I ever make alpha of it, then it will be propably compiled to NestJS + TypeORM project XD

## Why Satan?
Idk, it's edgy. I am not satanist thought.
